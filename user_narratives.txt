I arrive at workshop cafe, open the app and check in and add my workspot. If I have a 0 or negative account balance I am prompted ot add money

I want to order some food from my seat. I can hail the staff, or text in an order, email, or call. I can preview the menu and order something.

I recieve a push notification to let me know I have a negative account balance and I should refill my hours. I tap through and it prompts me to add 10 hours.

I can pay with a "VIP table" - why not with cover?

I can see a table of my utlization and add more time to my account

I can see the employee's profiles (team page)

I can see the privacy & terms of use (privacy and terms page)
