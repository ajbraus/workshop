                app, and website that are not resolved by mutual agreement may be resolved by
                binding arbitration to be conducted before JAMS, or its successor. Unless
                otherwise agreed by the parties, arbitration will be held in San Francisco,
                California before a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, or
                if the parties cannot mutually agree, a single arbitrator appointed by JAMS,
                and will be conducted in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated
                by JAMS unless specifically modified in the Terms of Service. The arbitration
                must commence within forty-five (45) days of the date on which a written demand
                for arbitration is filed by either party. The arbitrator's decision and award
                will be made and delivered within sixty (60) days of the conclusion of the
                arbitration and within six (6) months of the selection of the arbitrator. The
                arbitrator will not have the power to award damages in excess of the limitation
                on actual compensatory, direct damages set forth in the Terms of Service and
                may not multiply actual damages or award punitive damages or any other damages
                that are specifically excluded under the Terms of Service and each party hereby
                irrevocably waives any claim to such damages. The arbitrator may, in his or her
                discretion, assess costs and expenses (including the reasonable legal fees and
                expenses of the prevailing part) against any party to a proceeding. Any party
                refusing to comply with an order of the arbitrators will be liable for costs
                and expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by the other party in
                enforcing the award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of temporary or
                preliminary injunctive relief, any party may proceed in court without prior
                arbitration for the purpose of avoiding immediate and irreparable harm. The
                provisions of this arbitration section will be enforceable in any court of
                competent jurisdiction. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

                respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth
                above, you and Workshop Café agree to submit to the personal and exclusive
                jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within San Francisco
                County, California. The failure of Workshop Café to exercise or enforce any
                right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of
                such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by
                a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree
                that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as
                reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service
                remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or
                law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to
                use of the service, web-based mobile app, and website or these Terms of Service
                must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or
                be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given
                in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings
                based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the
                same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated
                and maintained in printed form. The section titles in these Terms of Service
                are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to
                you may be made via either email or regular mail. The service, web-based mobile
                app, and website may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service
                or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the service,
